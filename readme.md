## Code Examples

The following applications are provided to demonstrate the typical or interesting usage models of one or more peripheral libraries.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [AC Sleepwalking](apps/ac/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the AC Peripheral library to perform a single shot comparison in standby sleep mode periodically and wake up the device at the end of a successful comparison |
| [ADCHS Interrupt](apps/adchs/adchs_interrupt/readme.md) | This example application shows how to sample an analog input using the ADCHS peripheral and displays the converted samples on a serial terminal |
| [ADCHS polling](apps/adchs/adchs_polled/readme.md) | This example application shows how to sample an analog input using the ADCHS peripheral and displays the converted samples on a serial terminal |
| [CCL Manchester Encoder](apps/ccl/manchester_encoder/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the CCL peripheral library and generate a Manchester-encoded output |
| [Clock configuration](apps/clock/clock_config/readme.md) | This example application shows how to configure the clock system to run the device at maximum frequency. It also outputs a prescaled clock signal on a GPIO pin for measurement and verification |
| [DMAC USART echo](apps/dmac/dmac_usart_echo/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates USART transfer with DMA to receive 10 bytes and echo back the received bytes |
| [DMT timeout](apps/dmt/dmt_timeout/readme.md) | This example application shows how the deadman timer resets by not clearing the deadman timer counter on switch press |
| [DSU compute CRC32](apps/dsu/dsu_crc32_generate/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the DSU Peripheral library to compute 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Checksum (CRC) |
| [EIC Interrupt](apps/eic/eic_led_on_off/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to generate interrupt using the EIC on switch press and indicate it through an LED |
| [EVSYS trigger](apps/evsys/evsys_trigger/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the EVSYS Peripheral library to setup autonomous, low-latency and configurable communication between peripherals |
| [FREQM measurement](apps/freqm/freqm_measure_clock_freq/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the FREQM peripheral to measure the frequency of the internal RC Oscillator |
| [GPIO Polling](apps/gpio/gpio_led_on_off_polling/readme.md) | This example application demonstrate how to poll the switch input, and indicate the switch status using the LED |
| [NVM flash read write](apps/nvm/flash_read_write/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the NVM to erase and program the internal Flash memory |
| [QSPI flash read write](apps/qspi/qspi_read_write/readme.md) | This example shows how to use the QSPI Peripheral library to perform erase, write and read operation with the QSPI Serial Flash memory in Quad IO mode |
| [RTC alarm interrupt](apps/rtc/rtc_alarm/readme.md) | This example shows how to use the RTC to configure the time and generate the alarm |
| [SERCOM I2C EEPROM read write](apps/sercom/i2c/master/i2c_eeprom/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral to write and read from the I2C serial EEPROM memory |
| [SERCOM I2C EEPROM emulation](apps/sercom/i2c/slave/i2c_eeprom_emulation/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in slave mode |
| [SERCOM SPI EEPROM read write](apps/sercom/spi/spi_eeprom_write_read/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM SPI peripheral to write and read from the SPI serial EEPROM memory |
| [SERCOM USART ring buffer](apps/sercom/usart/usart_ring_buffer_interrupt/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART ring buffer mode to transfer data in a non-blocking manner |
| [Systick periodic interrupt](apps/systick/systick_periodic_timeout/readme.md) | This example shows how to use the SysTick to generate periodic interrupts |
| [TC timer mode](apps/tc/tc_timer_mode/readme.md) | This example shows how to use the TC module in timer mode to generate periodic interrupt |
| [WDT timeout](apps/wdt/wdt_timeout/readme.md) | This example application shows how the watchdog timer resets by not feeding the watchdog on switch press |
