# SERCOM SPI EEPROM read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM SPI peripheral to write and read from the SPI serial EEPROM memory.

## Description

This example uses the SERCOM SPI peripheral library to write an array of values to the SPI Serial EEPROM and verify the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

### Setting up [PIC32CX WBZ451 Curiosity Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EA71C53A)
- Plug an [EEPROM 4 Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) into the MikroBus socket of the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using J16a micro USB cable


## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
2. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Refer below table for LED name

| Board | LED Name |
